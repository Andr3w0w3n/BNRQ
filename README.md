Basic Nuke Render Queue


Description:
	Basic Nuke Render Queue is a side coding project developed by Andrew Owen that aims to provide a simple
	render queue for Foundry Nuke. It is run outside of nuke so there is no need to launch nuke to use the
	application. The code is open for anyone to see for not only clarity purposes but hopefully learning
	purposes as well. 

	
	Brief file descriptions:
		RenderQ.py is the application script

		RenderScript.py is the script that the application loads with nuke on renders to actually render the files.

		setup.py is for executable creation (using pyinstaller).
